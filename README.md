# combat-master-mod
a retexture mod for combat master

the goal of this retexture is to optimize the games visuals for better visibility, while also using pretty colors and adding some fun cosmetics :3 
this is mostly just a hub to host the link, the files are far too large to host a github. the link can be found here:

to install, navigate to your combat master directory. you can either do this through steam or directly through windows at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Combat Master\data\StreamingAssets\Bundles"

_**make a backup of the bundles folder first, important asf incase something breaks**_

simply drag the mod files into the bundles folder and select "replace" when prompted by windows.
now you can start the game and youre done :D
