# combat-master-mod
a retexture mod for combat master

the goal of this retexture is to optimize the games visuals for better visibility, while also using pretty colors and adding some fun cosmetics :3 
this is mostly just a hub to host the link, the files are far too large to host a github. the link can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MBoZs5SUmQp57lR-ulDzlXRiqOV5rjOi?usp=sharing

to install, navigate to your combat master directory. you can either do this through steam or directly through windows at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Combat Master\data\StreamingAssets\Bundles"

_**make a backup of the bundles folder first, important asf incase something breaks**_

simply drag the mod files into the bundles folder and select "replace" when prompted by windows.
now you can start the game and youre done :D


name customization tutorial also
you can customize your name with some HTML tags, most importantly the color related ones. 
to change name color you can either use <color=(colorname)> or you can use a hex value <#406>. 
hex values are much shorter and therefore more applicable, to find a hex value google "color picker" and use the provided tool. youll most likely get a 6 character hex, use this website to convert it to 3: http://maettig.com/?page=PHP/CSS_Color_Converter
other notable tags are <b> for bold, <i> for italics, <u> for underline, <mark> for a yellow background, etc
you can find a list of all html tags here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ however, keep in mind that most wont work.
