# combat-master-mod
a retexture mod for combat master

the goal of this retexture is to optimize the games visuals for better visibility, while also using pretty colors and adding some fun cosmetics :3 
the biggest change is making all maps be mostly flat colors, with very few exceptions. the map's baked in lighting is also replaced to brighten up maps. player models are still affected by real time lighting baked into the map, but the added brightness of the surroundings make the contrast far greater than in vanilla in most scenarios. theres also a few custom camos here and there.
this is mostly just a hub to host the link, the files are far too large to host a github. the link can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MBoZs5SUmQp57lR-ulDzlXRiqOV5rjOi?usp=sharing

to install, navigate to your combat master directory. you can either do this through steam or directly through windows at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Combat Master\data\StreamingAssets\Bundles`

_**make a backup of the bundles folder first, important asf incase something breaks**_

simply drag the mod files into the bundles folder and select "replace" when prompted by windows.
now you can start the game and youre done :D
i'll be semi-regularly updating this (prob once or twice a week) as long as im interested in the game

name customization tutorial also
you can customize your name with some HTML tags, most importantly the color related ones. 
to change name color you can either use `<color=(colorname)>` or you can use a hex value `<#406>`. 
hex values are much shorter and therefore more applicable, to find a hex value google "color picker" and use the provided tool. youll most likely get a 6 character hex, use this website to convert it to 3: http://maettig.com/?page=PHP/CSS_Color_Converter
other notable tags are `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italics, `<u>` for underline, `<mark>` for a yellow background, etc
you can find a list of all html tags here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ however, keep in mind that most wont work.

update to name thing, the tags are unity rich text tags. https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/StyledText.html
